/*
 After Ninja Forms was updated to 3.6.34, the initialization started to fire on the DOMContentLoaded event,
 but our lazy-loaded forms appeared on a page when this event was already fired.
 So now we load the addEventListener wrapper below as an async script, along with the other lazy-loaded forms scripts,
 e.g. front-end.js, and we call the initialization function manually.
